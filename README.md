# Individual Project 3: Cloud-based Big Data Systems Project

## Objectvices of Project

In Project 3, vehicle insurance customers data were analyzed with data visualization. A different types of predictive model including linear regression, Lasso regression, Elastic Net were used to compare the accuracy of models and predict whether a customer is likely to purchase vehicle insurance or not. The data includes 78,272 customers data with 8 different features including age, gender, driving license, region code, previously insured, vehicle age, vehicle damage, and policy sales channel. By analyzing this data and identifying patterns and trends, the project aims to gain insights into customer behavior and preferences, and ultimately develop a model that can help insurance companies target their marketing efforts more effectively and improve their conversion rates.
